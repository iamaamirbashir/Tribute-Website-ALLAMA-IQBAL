          <p>
            <b style="color: rgb(149, 92, 6)">Mohammad Iqbal (1877-1938)</b>, a
            descendant of a Kashmiri Brahmin family that had embraced Islam in
            the seventeenth century, was born and settled in Sialkot. After a
            traditional education in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, he was exposed
            to a liberal education that defined the contours of his thought and
            his poetry during the entire period of his life. Beginning his
            educational career at the Scottish Mission School, he went on to
            acquire his M. A. in Philosophy, before joining Trinity College, and
            later earning the degree of Bar-at-Law. He furthered his education
            by getting the degree of doctorate from Germany on The Development
            of Metaphysics in Persia. He worked in different capacities at
            different points of time; he taught philosophy, practised law, got
            involved in politics, and also attended the second Round Table
            Conference. Even while he favoured the idea of the creation of
            Pakistan and is venerated there as the national poet, he wrote the
            famous patriotic song that celebrates the greatness of India. King
            George V decorated him with knighthood and he was called Sir
            Mohammad Iqbal thereafter. Iqbal wrote both in Persian and Urdu, and
            is often regarded as the poet-philosopher of the East who addressed
            the Muslim ummah, believed in the philosophy of wahdatul wujood, and
            propounded the philosohy of khudi, or selfhood, which called for
            self-realisation and the discovery of the hidden talent with love
            and perseverance. Beyond that lay the stages of complete submission
            and forgetfulness which, he thought, was the ultimate stage of
            khudi. Iqbal dreamt of the ‘complete man’ and also entered into a
            metaphoric dialogue with the divine. His poetry emerged as a
            remarkable site where message and art coalesced, as he re-configured
            major poetic devices like metaphor, myth, and symbol to re-visit
            history, philosophy and the Islamic faith to develop his individual
            vision. He has left behind his collections of poems,
            <b style="color: rgb(149, 92, 6)">
              Asraar-e Khudi, Rumooz-e Bekhudi, Baang-e Daraa, Baal-e Jibreel,
              Payaam-e Mashriq, Zaboor-e ‘Ajm, Javed Naama, Zarb-e Kaleem, and
              Armaghaan-e Hijaz</b
            >, apart from his lectures collected in English as The
            Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, and other works on the
            Eastern worldview.
